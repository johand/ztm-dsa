** BFS vs DFS

1. If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
  *a:* BFS

2. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare
  *a:* BFS (DFS will take long time)

3. If the tree is very wide
  *a:* DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

4. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
  *a:* DFS

5. Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
  *a:* DFS

6. Finding the shortest path
  *a:* BFS
